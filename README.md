## Data preprocessing
is a crucial step in data analysis and machine learning. It involves a series of operations and techniques applied to raw data before it is used for analysis, modeling, or machine learning tasks. The primary objectives of data preprocessing are to clean, transform, and structure the data in a way that makes it suitable for the intended analysis or modeling process. Here are some common tasks involved in data preprocessing: 

## Feature selection
is a process in machine learning and data analysis that involves choosing a subset of the most relevant and informative features (variables or attributes) from a larger set of available features. The goal of feature selection is to improve the performance of a machine learning model or simplify data analysis by focusing on the most important characteristics of the data while discarding irrelevant or redundant ones.

# FEATURE SELECTION SUMMARY:

    Drop unique & Constant Column
    Check correlation with heatmap & Remove highly correlated feature
    Check Duplicates
    Principle component analysis
    Save pre-process data
